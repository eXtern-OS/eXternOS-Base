<H2><A NAME="routing"></A> <A NAME="ss5.1">5.1</A> <A HREF="BRLTTY.html#toc5.1">Cursor Routing</A>
</H2>

<P>When moving the braille window around the screen
while examining the text, say, in an editor,
you often need to bring the cursor
to a specific character within the braille window.
You'll probably find this to be a rather difficult task for a number of reasons.
One is that you may not know where the cursor is,
and that you may lose your place while trying to find it.
Another is that the cursor may move unpredictably as the arrow keys are pressed
(some editors, for example, don't allow the cursor to be
more to the right than the end of the line it's on).
Cursor routing provides just such a capability
by knowing where the cursor is,
by simulating the same arrow-key presses which you'd have to enter manually,
and by monitoring the progress of the cursor as it moves.</P>
<P>Some braille displays have a button, known as a routing key, above each cell.
These keys use the 
<A HREF="BRLTTY-4.html#command-ROUTE">ROUTE</A> command
to route the cursor right to the desired location.</P>
<P>Cursor routing, while very convenient and effective,
is, strictly speaking, not completely reliable.
One reason for this is that its current implementation assumes
VT100 cursor key escape sequences.
Another is that some applications do non-standard things
in response to detecting that a cursor key has been pressed.
A minor problem found within some editors (like <CODE>vi</CODE>),
as already mentioned above,
is that they throw in some unpredictable horizontal motion
when vertical motion is requested
because they don't allow the cursor to be to the right of the end of a line.
A major problem found within some web browsers (like <CODE>lynx</CODE>)
is that the up- and down-arrow keys are used to move among the links
(which may skip lines and/or move the cursor horizontally,
but which rarely just moves the cursor one line in the desired direction),
and that the left- and right-arrow keys are used to select links
(which has absolutely nothing to do with any form of cursor motion whatsoever,
and which even totally changes the screen content).</P>
<P>Cursor routing may not work very well on a heavily loaded system,
and definitely doesn't work very well when working on a remote system over a slow link.
This is so because of all of the checks which must be made along the way
in order to deal with unpredictable cursor motion
and in order to ensure that any mistake has at least a fighting chance to be undone.
Even  though BRLTTY tries to be fairly clever,
it must still essentially wait to see what happens after each simulated arrow-key press.</P>
<P>Once a cursor routing request has been made,
BRLTTY keeps trying to route the cursor to the desired location until
a timeout expires before the cursor reaches that location,
the cursor seems to be moving in the wrong direction,
or you switch to a different virtual terminal.
An attempt is first made to use vertical motion
to bring the cursor to the right line,
and, only if that succeeds, an attempt is then made
to use horizontal motion to bring the cursor to the right column.
If another request is made while one is still in progress,
then the first one is aborted and the second one is initiated.</P>
<P>A safer but less powerful cursor routing command,
<A HREF="BRLTTY-4.html#command-CSRJMP_VERT">CSRJMP_VERT</A>,
uses just vertical motion to bring the cursor
to anywhere on the top line of the braille window.
It's especially useful in conjunction with applications (like <CODE>lynx</CODE>)
wherein horizontal cursor motion must never be attempted.</P>

<H2><A NAME="cut"></A> <A NAME="ss5.2">5.2</A> <A HREF="BRLTTY.html#toc5.2">Cut and Paste</A>
</H2>

<P>This feature enables you to grab some text which is already on the screen 
and re-enter it at the current cursor position.
Using it saves time and avoids errors
when a long and/or complicated piece of text needs to be copied,
and even when the same short and simple piece of text needs to be copied many times.
It's particularly useful for things like
long file names,
complicated command lines,
E-mail addresses,
and URLs. Cutting and pasting text involves three simple steps:
<OL>
<LI>Mark either the top-left corner of the rectangular area
or the beginning of the linear area
on the screen which is to be grabbed (cut).
If your display has routing keys,
then move the braille window so that
the first character to be cut appears anywhere within it, and then:
<UL>
<LI>invoke the 
<A HREF="BRLTTY-4.html#command-CUTBEGIN">CUTBEGIN</A> command
to start a new cut buffer</LI>
<LI>invoke the 
<A HREF="BRLTTY-4.html#command-CUTAPPEND">CUTAPPEND</A> command
to append to the existing cut buffer</LI>
</UL>

by pressing the key(s) associated with it
and then pressing the routing key associated with the character.</LI>
<LI>Mark either the bottom-right corner of the rectangular area
or the end of the linear area
on the screen which is to be grabbed (cut).
If your display has routing keys,
then move the braille window so that
the last character to be cut appears anywhere within it, and then
<UL>
<LI>invoke the 
<A HREF="BRLTTY-4.html#command-CUTRECT">CUTRECT</A> command
to cut a rectangular area</LI>
<LI>invoke the 
<A HREF="BRLTTY-4.html#command-CUTLINE">CUTLINE</A> command
to cut a linear area</LI>
</UL>

by pressing the key(s) associated with it
and then pressing the routing key associated with the character.
Marking the end of the cut area
appends the selected screen content to the cut buffer.
Excess white-space is removed from the end of each line in the cut buffer
so that unwanted trailing spaces won't be pasted back in.
Control characters are replaced with blanks.</LI>
<LI>Insert (paste) the text where it's needed.
Place the cursor over the character where the text is to be pasted,
and invoke the 
<A HREF="BRLTTY-4.html#command-PASTE">PASTE</A> command.
You can paste the same text any number of times without recutting it.
This description assumes that you're already in some sort of input mode.
If you paste when you're in some other kind of mode
(like <CODE>vi</CODE>'s command mode),
then you'd better be aware of what the characters in the cut buffer will do.</LI>
</OL>
</P>
<P>The cut buffer is also used by
the 
<A HREF="BRLTTY-4.html#command-PRSEARCH-NXSEARCH">PRSEARCH/NXSEARCH</A> commands.</P>

<H2><A NAME="gpm"></A> <A NAME="ss5.3">5.3</A> <A HREF="BRLTTY.html#toc5.3">Pointer (Mouse) Support via GPM</A>
</H2>

<P>If BRLTTY is configured with the 
<A HREF="BRLTTY-3.html#build-gpm">--enable-gpm</A> build option
on a system where the <CODE>gpm</CODE> application has been installed,
then it'll interact with the pointer (mouse).</P>
<P>Moving the pointer drags the braille window
(see the 
<A HREF="#preference-window-follows-pointer">Window Follows Pointer</A> preference).
Whenever the pointer is moved beyond the edge of the braille window,
the braille window is dragged along (one character at a time).
This gives the braille user another two-dimensional way
to inspect the screen content
or to quickly move the braille window to a desired location.
It also gives a sighted observer an easy way to move the braille window
to something he'd like the braille user to read.</P>
<P><CODE>gpm</CODE> uses reverse video to show where the pointer is.
Underlining of highlighted characters
(see the 
<A HREF="BRLTTY-4.html#command-ATTRVIS">ATTRVIS</A> command for details)
should be turned on, therefore, when the braille user wishes to use the pointer.</P>
<P>This feature also gives the braille user access to <CODE>gpm</CODE>'s cut-and-paste capability.
Although you should read <CODE>gpm</CODE>'s own documentation,
here are some notes on how it works.
<UL>
<LI>Copy the current character to the cut buffer
by single-clicking the left button.</LI>
<LI>Copy the current word (space-delimited) to the cut buffer
by double-clicking the left button.</LI>
<LI>Copy the current line to the cut buffer
by tripple-clicking the left button.</LI>
<LI>Copy a linear region to the cut buffer as follows:
<OL>
<LI>Place the pointer on the first character of the region.</LI>
<LI>Press (and hold) the left button.</LI>
<LI>Move the pointer to the last character of the region
(all currently selected characters are highlighted).</LI>
<LI>Release the left button.</LI>
</OL>
</LI>
<LI>Paste (input) the current contents of the cut buffer
by clicking the middle button of a three-button mouse
or by clicking the right button of a two-button mouse.</LI>
<LI>Append to the cut buffer
by using the right button of a three-button mouse.</LI>
</UL>

<H2><A NAME="tunes"></A> <A NAME="ss5.4">5.4</A> <A HREF="BRLTTY.html#toc5.4">Alert Tunes</A>
</H2>

<P>BRLTTY alerts you to the occurrence of significant events
by playing short predefined tunes.
This feature can be activated and deactivated with
either the 
<A HREF="BRLTTY-4.html#command-TUNES">TUNES</A> command
or the 
<A HREF="#preference-alert-tunes">Alert Tunes</A> preference.
The tunes are played via the internal beeper by default,
but other alternatives can be selected
with the 
<A HREF="#preference-tune-device">Tune Device</A> preference.</P>
<P>Each significant event is associated, from highest to lowest priority,
with one or more of the following:
<DL>
<DT><B>a tune</B><DD>
<P>If a tune has been associated with the event,
if the 
<A HREF="#preference-alert-tunes">Alert Tunes</A> preference
(see also the 
<A HREF="BRLTTY-4.html#command-TUNES">TUNES</A> command)
is active,
and if the selected tune device
(see the 
<A HREF="#preference-tune-device">Tune Device</A> preference)
can be opened,
then the tune is played.</P>
<DT><B>a dot pattern</B><DD>
<P>If a dot pattern has been associated with the event,
and if the 
<A HREF="#preference-alert-dots">Alert Dots</A> preference is active,
then the dot pattern is briefly displayed on every braille cell.
Some braille displays don't respond quickly enough
for this mechanism to work effectively.</P>
<DT><B>a message</B><DD>
<P>If a message has been associated with the event,
and if the 
<A HREF="#preference-alert-messages">Alert Messages</A> preference is active,
then it is displayed for a few seconds
(see the 
<A HREF="BRLTTY-4.html#options-message-timeout">-M</A> command line option).</P>
</DL>
</P>
<P>These events include:
<UL>
<LI>When the braille display driver starts or stops.</LI>
<LI>When a lengthy command completes.</LI>
<LI>When a command cannot be executed.</LI>
<LI>When a mark is set.</LI>
<LI>When the start or end of the cut block is set.</LI>
<LI>When a feature is activated or deactivated.</LI>
<LI>When cursor tracking is turned on or off.</LI>
<LI>When the screen image is frozen or unfrozen.</LI>
<LI>When the braille window wraps
either down to the beginning of the next line
or up to the end of the previous line.</LI>
<LI>When identical lines are skipped.</LI>
<LI>When a requested motion cannot be performed.</LI>
<LI>When cursor routing starts, finishes, or fails.</LI>
</UL>

<H2><A NAME="preferences"></A> <A NAME="ss5.5">5.5</A> <A HREF="BRLTTY.html#toc5.5">Preferences Settings</A>
</H2>

<P>When BRLTTY starts, it loads a file which contains your preferences settings.
The file doesn't need to exist,
and is created the first time the settings are saved
with the 
<A HREF="BRLTTY-4.html#command-PREFSAVE">PREFSAVE</A> command.
The most recently saved settings can be restored at any time
with the 
<A HREF="BRLTTY-4.html#command-PREFLOAD">PREFLOAD</A> command.</P>
<P>The name for this file is <CODE>/etc/brltty-</CODE><EM>driver</EM><CODE>.prefs</CODE>.
where <EM>driver</EM> is the two-letter 
<A HREF="BRLTTY-10.html#drivers">driver identification code</A>.</P>

<H3><A NAME="preferences-menu"></A> The Preferences Menu</H3>

<P>The preferences settings are saved as binary data
which, therefore, can't be edited by hand.
BRLTTY, however, has a simple menu from which you can easily change them.</P>
<P>The menu is activated by the 
<A HREF="BRLTTY-4.html#command-PREFMENU">PREFMENU</A> command.
The braille display briefly
(see the 
<A HREF="BRLTTY-4.html#options-message-timeout">-M</A> command line option)
shows the menu title,
and then presents the current item and its current setting.</P>

<H3>Navigating the Menu</H3>

<P>See 
<A HREF="BRLTTY-4.html#menu-navigation">Menu Navigation Commands</A> for the full list of
commands which enable you to select items and change settings within the menu.
For backward compatibility with old drivers, the window motion commands,
which have modified meanings in this context, can also be used.

</DL>
</P>
<P>Notes:
<UL>
<LI>The routing keys can also be used to select a setting for the current item.
If the item has numeric settings,
then the entire row of routing keys acts as a scroll bar
which covers the full range of valid values.
If the item has named settings,
then the routing keys correspond ordinally with the settings.</LI>
<LI>Use the <CODE>PREFLOAD</CODE> command to undo all of the changes
which were made since entering the menu.</LI>
<LI>Use the <CODE>PREFMENU</CODE> command (again) to leave the new settings in effect,
exit the menu, and resume normal operation.
If the "Save Settings on Exit" item is set, then, in addition,
the new settings are written to the preferences settings file.
Any command not recognized by the menu system also does these same things.</LI>

<H2><A NAME="learn"></A> <A NAME="ss5.7">5.7</A> <A HREF="BRLTTY.html#toc5.7">Command Learn Mode</A>
</H2>

<P>Command learn mode is an interactive way to learn
what the keys on the braille display do.
It can be accessed
either by the 
<A HREF="BRLTTY-4.html#command-LEARN">LEARN</A> command
or via the 
<A HREF="BRLTTY-3.html#utility-brltest">brltest</A> utility.
This feature isn't available if the
<A HREF="BRLTTY-3.html#build-learn-mode">--disable-learn-mode</A> build option was specified.</P>
<P>When this mode is entered,
the message <CODE>command learn mode</CODE> is written to the braille display.
Then, as each key (or key combination) on the display is pressed,
a short message describing its BRLTTY function is written.
This mode exits immediately if the key (or key combination)
for the 
<A HREF="BRLTTY-4.html#command-LEARN">LEARN</A> command is pressed.
It exits automatically, and the message <CODE>done</CODE> is written,
if ten seconds elapse without any key on the display being pressed.
Note that some displays don't signal the driver
and/or some drivers don't signal BRLTTY
until all the keys are released.</P>
<P>If a message is longer than the braille display is wide,
then it's displayed in segments.
The length of each segment but the last is one less than the display's width,
with the rightmost character on the display being set to a minus sign.
Each such segment remains on the display
either for a few seconds
(see the 
<A HREF="BRLTTY-4.html#options-message-timeout">-M</A> command line option)
or until any key on the display is pressed.</P>
