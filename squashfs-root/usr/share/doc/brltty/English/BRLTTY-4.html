<H2><A NAME="s4">4.</A> <A HREF="BRLTTY.html#toc4">Using BRLTTY</A></H2>

<P>Before starting BRLTTY, you need to set up your braille display.
In most cases this is done simply
by connecting it to an available serial port,
and then turning it on.
After your display has been set up,
run BRLTTY simply by typing the command <CODE>brltty</CODE> at a shell prompt
(this must be done as root).
Check the
<A HREF="#options-braille-device">-d</A> command line option,
the 
<A HREF="#configure-braille-device">braille-device</A> configuration file directive,
and the 
<A HREF="BRLTTY-3.html#build-braille-device">--with-braille-device</A> build option
for alternatives regarding how to tell BRLTTY which device your display is connected to.
Check the
<A HREF="#options-braille-driver">-b</A> command line option,
the 
<A HREF="#configure-braille-driver">braille-driver</A> configuration file directive,
and the 
<A HREF="BRLTTY-3.html#build-braille-driver">--with-braille-driver</A> build option
for alternatives regarding how to tell BRLTTY which kind of braille display you have.
Check the
<A HREF="#options-braille-parameters">-B</A> command line option,
and the 
<A HREF="#configure-braille-parameters">braille-parameters</A> configuration file directive
for alternatives regarding how to pass parameters to the driver for your braille display.</P>
<P>A message giving the program name (BRLTTY) and its version number
will appear briefly
(see the 
<A HREF="#options-message-timeout">-M</A> command line option)
on the braille display.
The display will then show a small area of the screen including the cursor.
By default, the cursor is represented as
dots 7 and 8 superimposed on the character it is on.</P>
<P>Any screen activity will be reflected on the braille display.
The display will also follow the progress of the cursor on the screen.  
This feature is known as <B>cursor tracking</B>.</P>
<P>Just typing on the keyboard and reading the display, however, isn't enough.
Try entering a command which will cause an error, and pressing <B>enter</B>.  
The error appears on the screen, but, unless you have a multi-line display,
the chances are that it isn't visible on the braille display.
All you see thereon is another shell prompt.
What's needed, then, is some way to move
the braille <EM>window</EM> around the screen.
The keys on the braille display itself can be used to send commands to BRLTTY
which, in addition to a lot of other things, can also do exactly that.</P>

<H2><A NAME="commands"></A> <A NAME="ss4.1">4.1</A> <A HREF="BRLTTY.html#toc4.1">Commands</A>
</H2>

<P>Unfortunately, the various braille displays don't offer a standard set of controls.
Some have the six standard dot keys, some have eight, and others have none.
Some have thumb keys, but there's no standard number of them.
Some have a button above each braille cell.
Some have rocker switches.
Some have an easy-to-reach bar which works much like a joystick.
Most have varying combinations of the above.
Because the nature and layout of each display is so different,
please refer to the documentation for your particular display
in order to find out exactly what its keys do.</P>
<P>BRLTTY commands are referred to by name within this manual.
If you forget which key(s) on your braille display to use
for a particular command, then refer to its driver's help page.
The main key you should immediately commit to memory, therefore, is the one
for the 
<A HREF="#command-HELP">HELP</A> command.
Use the regular motion keys (as described below) to navigate the help page,
and press the <CODE>help</CODE> key again to quit.</P>

routing key commands.
<DL>
<DT><B>LNUP/LNDN
<A NAME="command-LNUP-LNDN"></A> </B><DD>
<P>Go up/down one line.
If identical line skipping has been activated
(see the 
<A HREF="#command-SKPIDLNS">SKPIDLNS</A> command),
then these commands, rather than moving exactly one line,
are aliases for the 
<A HREF="#command-PRDIFLN-NXDIFLN">PRDIFLN/NXDIFLN</A> commands.</P>
<DT><B>WINUP/WINDN
<A NAME="command-WINUP-WINDN"></A> </B><DD>
<P>Go up/down one window.
If the window is only 1 line high then move 5 lines.</P>
<DT><B>PRDIFLN/NXDIFLN
<A NAME="command-PRDIFLN-NXDIFLN"></A> </B><DD>
<P>Go up/down to the nearest line with different content.
If identical line skipping has been activated
(see the 
<A HREF="#command-SKPIDLNS">SKPIDLNS</A> command),
then these commands, rather than skipping identical lines,
are aliases for the 
<A HREF="#command-LNUP-LNDN">LNUP/LNDN</A> commands.</P>
<DT><B>ATTRUP/ATTRDN
<A NAME="command-ATTRUP-ATTRDN"></A> </B><DD>
<P>Go up/down to the nearest line with different attributes (character highlighting).</P>
<DT><B>TOP/BOT
<A NAME="command-TOP-BOT"></A> </B><DD>
<P>Go to the top/bottom line.</P>
<DT><B>TOP_LEFT/BOT_LEFT
<A NAME="command-TOP_LEFT-BOT_LEFT"></A> </B><DD>
<P>Go to the top-left/bottom-left corner.</P>
<DT><B>PRPGRPH/NXPGRPH
<A NAME="command-PRPGRPH-NXPGRPH"></A> </B><DD>
<P>Go to the nearest line of the previous/next paragraph
(the first non-blank line beyond the nearest blank line).
The current line is included when searching for the inter-paragraph space.</P>
<DT><B>PRPROMPT/NXPROMPT
<A NAME="command-PRPROMPT-NXPROMPT"></A> </B><DD>
<P>Go to the previous/next command prompt.</P>
<DT><B>PRSEARCH/NXSEARCH
<A NAME="command-PRSEARCH-NXSEARCH"></A> </B><DD>
<P>Search backward/forward for the nearest occurrence
of the character string within the cut buffer
(see 
<A HREF="BRLTTY-5.html#cut">Cut and Paste</A>)
which isn't within the braille window.
The search proceeds to the left/right,
starting at the character immediately to the left/right of the window,
and wrapping at the edge of the screen.
The search isn't case sensitive.</P>

<H3><A NAME="horizontal-motion"></A> Horizontal Motion</H3>

<P>See also the 
<A HREF="#command-SETLEFT">SETLEFT</A> routing key command.
<DL>
<DT><B>CHRLT/CHRRT
<A NAME="command-CHRLT-CHRRT"></A> </B><DD>
<P>Go left/right one character.</P>
<DT><B>HWINLT/HWINRT

<P>Go left/right half a window.</P>
<DT><B>FWINLT/FWINRT
<A NAME="command-FWINLT-FWINRT"></A> </B><DD>
<P>Go left/right one window.
These commands are particularly useful
because they automatically wrap when they reach the edge of the screen.
Other features, like their ability to skip blank windows
(see the 
<A HREF="#command-SKPBLNKWINS">SKPBLNKWINS</A> command),
further enhance their usefulness.</P>
<DT><B>FWINLTSKIP/FWINRTSKIP

<P>Go to where the cursor is.</P>
<DT><B>BACK
<A NAME="command-BACK"></A> </B><DD>
<P>Go back to where the most recent motion command put the braille window.
This is an easy way to get right back to where you were reading
after an unexpected event (like cursor tracking)
moves the braille window at an inopportune moment.</P>
<DT><B>RETURN
<A NAME="command-RETURN"></A> </B><DD>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>If the most recent motion of the braille window was automatic,
e.g. as a result of cursor tracking,
then go back to where the most recent motion command put it
(see the 
<A HREF="#command-BACK">BACK</A> command).</LI>
<LI>If the cursor isn't within the braille window
then go to where the cursor is
(see the 
<A HREF="#command-HOME">HOME</A> command).</LI>
</UL>

<H3><A NAME="feature-activation"></A> Feature Activation</H3>

<P>Each of these commands has three forms:
<B>activate</B> (turn the feature on),
<B>deactivate</B> (turn the feature off),
and <B>toggle</B> (if it's off then turn it on, and if it's on then turn it off).
Unless specifically noted, each of these features
is initially <B>off</B>, and, when <B>on</B>, affects BRLTTY's operation as a whole.
The initial setting of some of these features can be changed
via the 
<A HREF="BRLTTY-5.html#preferences-menu">preferences menu</A>.
<DL>
<DT><B>FREEZE
<A NAME="command-FREEZE"></A> </B><DD>
<P>Freeze the screen image.
BRLTTY makes a copy of the screen (content and attributes)
as of the moment when the screen image is frozen,
and then ignores all updating of the screen until it's unfrozen.
This feature makes it easy, for example,
to sample the output of an application which writes too much too quickly.</P>
<DT><B>DISPMD
<A NAME="command-DISPMD"></A> </B><DD>
<P>Show the highlighting (the attributes)
of each character within the braille window,
rather than the characters themselves (the content).
This feature is useful, for example,
when you need to locate a highlighted item.
When showing screen content, the text table is used
(see the 
<A HREF="#options-text-table">-t</A> command line option,
the 
<A HREF="#configure-text-table">text-table</A> configuration file directive,
and the 
<A HREF="BRLTTY-3.html#build-text-table">--with-text-table</A> build option).
When showing screen attributes, the attributes table is used
(see the 
<A HREF="#options-attributes-table">-a</A> command line option,
the 
<A HREF="#configure-attributes-table">attributes-table</A> configuration file directive,
and the 
<A HREF="BRLTTY-3.html#build-attributes-table">--with-attributes-table</A> build option).
This feature only affects the current virtual terminal.</P>
<DT><B>SIXDOTS
<A NAME="command-SIXDOTS"></A> </B><DD>
<P>Show characters using 6-dot, rather than 8-dot, braille.
Dots 7 and 8 are still used by other features
like cursor representation and highlighted character underlining.
If a contraction table has been selected
(see the 
<A HREF="#options-contraction-table">-c</A> command line option
and the 
<A HREF="#configure-contraction-table">contraction-table</A> configuration file directive),
then it is used.
This setting can also be changed with the
<A HREF="BRLTTY-5.html#preference-text-style">Text Style</A> preference.</P>
<DT><B>SLIDEWIN
<A NAME="command-SLIDEWIN"></A> </B><DD>
<P>If cursor tracking
(see the 
<A HREF="#command-CSRTRK">CSRTRK</A> command)
is <B>on</B>, then,
whenever the cursor moves too close to (or beyond)
either end of the braille window,
horizontally reposition the window such that the cursor,
while remaining on that side, is nearer the centre.
If this feature is <B>off</B>,
then the braille window is always positioned such that
its left end is a multiple of its width from the left edge of the screen.
This setting can also be changed with the
<A HREF="BRLTTY-5.html#preference-sliding-window">Sliding Window</A> preference.</P>
<DT><B>SKPIDLNS
<A NAME="command-SKPIDLNS"></A> </B><DD>
<P>Rather than explicitly moving exactly one line either up or down,
skip past lines which have the same content as the current line.
This feature affects
the 
<A HREF="#command-LNUP-LNDN">LNUP/LNDN</A> commands,
as well as the line wrapping feature of
the 
<A HREF="#command-FWINLT-FWINRT">FWINLT/FWINRT</A>
and 
<A HREF="#command-FWINLTSKIP-FWINRTSKIP">FWINLTSKIP/FWINRTSKIP</A> commands.
This setting can also be changed with the
<A HREF="BRLTTY-5.html#preference-skip-identical-lines">Skip Identical Lines</A> preference.</P>
<DT><B>SKPBLNKWINS
<A NAME="command-SKPBLNKWINS"></A> </B><DD>
<P>Skip past blank windows when reading either forward or backward.
This feature affects the 
<A HREF="#command-FWINLT-FWINRT">FWINLT/FWINRT</A> commands.
This setting can also be changed with the
<A HREF="BRLTTY-5.html#preference-skip-blank-windows">Skip Blank Windows</A> preference.</P>
<DT><B>CSRVIS
<A NAME="command-CSRVIS"></A> </B><DD>
<P>Show the cursor by superimposing a dot pattern
(see the 
<A HREF="#command-CSRSIZE">CSRSIZE</A> command)
on top of the character where it is.
This feature is initially <B>on</B>.
This setting can also be changed with the
<A HREF="BRLTTY-5.html#preference-show-cursor">Show Cursor</A> preference.</P>
<DT><B>CSRHIDE
<A NAME="command-CSRHIDE"></A> </B><DD>
<P>Hide the cursor (see the 
<A HREF="#command-CSRVIS">CSRVIS</A> command)
in order to accurately read the character beneath it.
This feature only affects the current virtual terminal.</P>
<DT><B>CSRTRK
<A NAME="command-CSRTRK"></A> </B><DD>
<P>Track (follow) the cursor.
If the cursor moves to a location which isn't within the braille window,
then automatically move the braille window to the cursor's new location.
You'll usually want this feature turned on
since it minimizes the effects of screen scrolling,
and since, during input, the region wherein you're currently typing is always visible.
If this feature causes the braille window to jump at an inopportune moment,
then use the 
<A HREF="#command-BACK">BACK</A> command
to get back to where you were reading.
You may need to turn this feature off when using an application which
continually updates the screen while maintaining a fixed data layout.
This feature is initially <B>on</B>.
This feature only affects the current virtual terminal.</P>
<DT><B>CSRSIZE
<A NAME="command-CSRSIZE"></A> </B><DD>
<P>Represent the cursor with all eight dots (a solid block),
rather than with just dots 7 and 8 (an underline).
This setting can also be changed with the
<A HREF="BRLTTY-5.html#preference-cursor-style">Cursor Style</A> preference.</P>
<DT><B>CSRBLINK
<A NAME="command-CSRBLINK"></A> </B><DD>

the symbol representing the cursor
(see the 
<A HREF="#command-CSRVIS">CSRVIS</A> command).
This setting can also be changed with the
<A HREF="BRLTTY-5.html#preference-blinking-cursor">Blinking Cursor</A> preference.</P>
<DT><B>ATTRVIS
<A NAME="command-ATTRVIS"></A> </B><DD>
<P>Underline (with combinations of dots 7 and 8) highlighted characters.
<DL>

<DT><B>ATTRBLINK
<A NAME="command-ATTRBLINK"></A> </B><DD>
<P>Blink (turn on and off according to a predefined interval)
the attribute underline
(see the 
<A HREF="#command-ATTRVIS">ATTRVIS</A> command).
This feature is initially <B>on</B>.
This setting can also be changed with the
<A HREF="BRLTTY-5.html#preference-blinking-attributes">Blinking Attributes</A> preference.</P>
<DT><B>CAPBLINK
<A NAME="command-CAPBLINK"></A> </B><DD>
<P>Blink (turn on and off according to a predefined interval)
capital (uppercase) letters.
This setting can also be changed with the
<A HREF="BRLTTY-5.html#preference-blinking-capitals">Blinking Capitals</A> preference.</P>
<DT><B>TUNES
<A NAME="command-TUNES"></A> </B><DD>
<P>Play a short predefined tune (see 
<A HREF="BRLTTY-5.html#tunes">Alert Tunes</A>)
whenever a significant event occurs.
This feature is initially <B>on</B>.
This setting can also be changed with the
<A HREF="BRLTTY-5.html#preference-alert-tunes">Alert Tunes</A> preference.</P>
<DT><B>AUTOREPEAT
<A NAME="command-AUTOREPEAT"></A> </B><DD>
<P>Automatically repeat a command at a regular interval
after an initial delay
while its key (combination) remains pressed.
Only some drivers support this functionality,
the primary limitation being that many braille displays
don't signal key presses and key releases as distinctly separate events.
This feature is initially <B>on</B>.
This setting can also be changed with the
<A HREF="BRLTTY-5.html#preference-autorepeat">Autorepeat</A> preference.</P>
<DT><B>AUTOSPEAK
<A NAME="command-AUTOSPEAK"></A> </B><DD>
<P>Automatically speak:
<UL>
<LI>the new line when the braille window is moved vertically.</LI>
<LI>characters which are entered or deleted.</LI>

<P>Route (bring) the cursor to anywhere on the top line of the braille window
(see 
<A HREF="BRLTTY-5.html#routing">Cursor Routing</A> for full details).
The cursor is moved by simulating vertical arrow-key presses.
This command doesn't always work because some applications
either move the cursor somewhat unpredictably
or use the arrow keys for purposes other than cursor motion.
It's somewhat safer than the other cursor routing commands, though,
because it makes no attempt to simulate the left- and right-arrows.</P>
