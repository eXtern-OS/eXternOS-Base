This is Debian's prepackaged version of Andrew Tridgell and
Paul Mackerras' rsync utility.

This package provides the rsync program, which is a replacement
for rcp that uses the rsync algorythm to transfer only the
differences between two sets of files.

This package was put together by Philip Hands <phil@hands.com>,
from sources obtained from:
  http://rsync.samba.org/ftp/rsync/rsync-2.5.4.tar.gz
The current version was downloaded from:
  http://rsync.samba.org/ftp/rsync/src/rsync-3.1.0.tar.gz
on 2013-09-30 by Paul Slootman <paul@debian.org> .

The changes were very minimal - merely adding support for the Debian
package maintenance scheme by adding various debian/* files.
The only significant change is passing the -4 / -6 options through to ssh.
See the debian/patches/ directory.
