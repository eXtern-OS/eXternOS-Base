NAME

    XML::Twig - Tree interface to XML documents allowing processing chunk
                by chunk of huge documents.

                

SUMMARY (see perldoc XML::Twig for full details)

XML::Twig is (yet another!) XML transformation module. 

Its strong points: can be used to process huge documents while still
being in tree mode; not bound by DOM or SAX, so it is very perlish and
offers a very comprehensive set of methods; simple to use; DWIMs as
much as possible

What it doesn't offer: full SAX support (it can export SAX, but only
reads XML), full XPath support (unless you use XML::Twig::XPath), nor
DOM support.

Other drawbacks: it is a big module, and with over 500 methods available
it can be a bit overwhelming. A good starting point is the tutorial at
http://xmltwig.org/xmltwig/tutorial/index.html. In fact the whole
XML::Twig page at http://xmltwig.org/xmltwig/ has plenty of information
to get you started with XML::Twig

TOOLS

XML::Twig comes with a few tools built on top of it:

  xml_pp           XML pretty printer
  xml_grep         XML grep - grep XML files using XML::Twig's subset of XPath
  xml_split        split big XML files
  xml_merge        merge back files created by xml_split
  xml_spellcheck   spellcheck XML files skipping tags

Running perl Makefile.PL will prompt you for each tool installation. 
  perl Makefile.PL -y     will install all of the tools without prompt
  perl Makefile.PL -n     will skip the installation of the tools


SYNOPSYS

  single-tree mode    
    my $t= XML::Twig->new();
    $t->parsefile( 'doc.xml');
    $t->print;

  chunk mode 
    # print the document, at most one full section is loaded in memory
    my $t= XML::Twig->new( twig_handlers => { section => \&flush});
    $t->parsefile( 'doc.xml');
    $t->flush;
    sub flush { (my $twig, $section)= @_; $twig->flush; }
    
  sub-tree mode 
    # print all section title's in the document,
    # all other elements are ignored (and not stored)
    my $t= XML::Twig->new( 
            twig_roots => { 'section/title' => sub { $_->print, "\n" } }
                         );
    $t->parsefile( 'doc.xml');
    
INSTALLATION

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

DEPENDENCIES

    XML::Twig needs XML::Parser (and the expat library) installed
   
    Modules that can enhance XML::Twig are:

    Scalar::Util or WeakRef 
      to avoid memory leaks
    Encode or Text::Iconv or Unicode::Map8 and Unicode::Strings 
      to do encoding conversions
    Tie::IxHash 
      to use the keep_atts_order option
    XML::XPathEngine 
      to use XML::Twig::XPath
    LWP 
      to use parseurl
    HTML::Entities
      to use the html_encode filter
    HTML::TreeBuilder
      to process HTML instead of XML
