 Repacked to remove included RFC5071 which violates the DFSG.  Also removed are
 the binary build dirs (bios, efi32, efi64) to make sure they are properly
 built from source and the debian directory from the included gnu-efi (which
 confuses uscan).
Files-Excluded:
 bios

 efi64

 Fortunately, that GPL-incompatible license only applies to two files
 (core/lwip/src/netif/ppp/ppp_oe.c and core/lwip/src/include/netif/ppp_oe.h)
 whose code is not used in the resulting library due to the configuration
 in effect (see PPPOE_SUPPORT set to 0 in core/lwip/src/include/lwip/opt.h).
