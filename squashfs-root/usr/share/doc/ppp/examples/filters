# These filter rules should prevent unwanted internet services to
# keep your connections up by ignoring their connection requests
# and your 'go way' responses.
#
# Activate them by activating the line 'file /etc/ppp/filters' in
# /etc/ppp/options.
#
# Note: This has nothing to do with firewall rules. It only affects
# the idle time calculation of the kernel/pppd.
