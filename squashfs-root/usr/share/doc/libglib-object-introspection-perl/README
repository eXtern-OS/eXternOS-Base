BUG REPORTS
-----------
For help with problems, please contact the mailing list (above).  If you
already know you have a bug, please file it with one of the bug trackers
below.  With any problems and/or bug reports, it's always helpful for the
developers to have the following information:

- A small script that demonstrates the problem; this is not required, however,
  it will get your issue looked at much faster than a description of the
  problem alone.
- Version of Perl (perl -v)
- Versions of Gtk2-Perl modules (Glib/Gtk2/Pango/Cairo)
- Optional, but nice to have: versions of GTK+ libraries on your system
  (libglib, libgtk+, libpango, libcairo, etc.)

There are multiple project bug trackers, please choose the one you are most
comfortable with using and/or already have an account for.

Request Tracker:
- submitting bugs via the Web (requires a PAUSE account/Bitcard):
  https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Report.html?Queue=Glib-Object-Introspection
- submitting bugs via e-mail (open to anyone with e-mail):
  bug-Glib-Object-Introspection [at] rt.cpan.org

- E-mailing it to the mailing list (above); please use a pastebin service of
  some kind for longer patchfiles (over say 20k in size).

  you're not sure what a trivial patch is, please ask first on the mailing
  list prior to pushing your commit.
