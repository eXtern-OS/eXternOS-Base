 publicly available standard specifications and network programming art,
 and assumes that the reader either is familiar with the aforementioned

 require the use of Microsoft programming tools or programming environments
 in order for you to develop an implementation. If you have access to
 Microsoft programming tools and environments you are free to take
 advantage of them.
