<P>Common wisdom in the computer security arena is to block everything,
then open up holes as neccessary.  This is usually phrased `that which
is not explicitly allowed is prohibited'.  I recommend this approach
if security is your maximal concern.</P>

<P>Do not run any services you do not need to, even if you think you
have blocked access to them.</P>

<P>If you are creating a dedicated firewall, start by running nothing,
and blocking all packets, then add services and let packets through as
required.</P>

<P>I recommend security in depth: combine tcp-wrappers (for
connections to the packet filter itself), proxies (for connections
passing through the packet filter), route verification and packet
filtering.  Route verification is where a packet which comes from an
unexpected interface is dropped: for example, if your internal network
has addresses 10.1.1.0/24, and a packet with that source address comes
in your external interface, it will be dropped.  This can be enabled
for one interface (ppp0) like so:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/ppp0/rp_filter
#
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Or for all existing and future interfaces like this:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# for f in /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/*/rp_filter; do
#     echo 1 > $f
# done
#
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Debian does this by default where possible.  If you have asymmetric
routing (ie. you expect packets coming in from strange directions),
you will want to disable this filtering on those interfaces.</P>

<P>Logging is useful when setting up a firewall if something isn't
working, but on a production firewall, always combine it with the
`limit' match, to prevent someone from flooding your logs.</P>

<P>I highly recommend connection tracking for secure systems: it
introduces some overhead, as all connections are tracked, but is very
useful for controlling access to your networks.  You may need to load
the `ip_conntrack.o' module if your kernel does not load modules
automatically, and it's not built into the kernel.  If you want to
accurately track complex protocols, you'll need to load the
appropriate helper module (eg. `ip_conntrack_ftp.o').</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# iptables -N no-conns-from-ppp0
# iptables -A no-conns-from-ppp0 -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
# iptables -A no-conns-from-ppp0 -m state --state NEW -i ! ppp0 -j ACCEPT
# iptables -A no-conns-from-ppp0 -i ppp0 -m limit -j LOG --log-prefix "Bad packet from ppp0:"
# iptables -A no-conns-from-ppp0 -i ! ppp0 -m limit -j LOG --log-prefix "Bad packet not from ppp0:"
# iptables -A no-conns-from-ppp0 -j DROP

# iptables -A INPUT -j no-conns-from-ppp0
# iptables -A FORWARD -j no-conns-from-ppp0
</PRE>

</P>

<P>Building a good firewall is beyond the scope of this HOWTO, but my
advice is `always be minimalist'.  See the Security HOWTO for more
information on testing and probing your box.</P>
