Comment: The following changes were made to the upstream tarball:
 1.) The directory dialects/uw was removed for being non-DFSG
 and not needed in Debian.
 2.) The main source was a tarball within a tarball. Only the innermost
 tarball has been retained.
 3.) The top-level directory has been stripped away as it embedded the
 version number making packaging more difficult.
