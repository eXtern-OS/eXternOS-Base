 IEEE does not assert any copyright in the OUI Public Listing or attempt
 to restrict distribution of the listing in any way. The IEEE
 Registration Authority does, however, strongly encourage those who use
 the list to obtain it directly from IEEE (and to update it on a regular
 basis) to ensure the integrity of the information.

 This means:
 - IEEE does not assert copyright
 - IEEE does not restrict distribution of the listing in any way
 - IEEE strongly encourages to get the list directly from IEEE (but it's
 only a strong encouragement)
