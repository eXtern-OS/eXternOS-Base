# Known obsolete packages.  Not all packages are added to this list, only
# ones for which it's helpful for Lintian to warn about, such as
# significant transitions or transitional packages that we're trying to
# remove from the archive.
#
# Each list of packages should be tagged with the last Debian release in
# which the package appeared so that we can remove long-obsolete entries
# that are no longer worth checking for.
#
# It is possible to specify a replacement (which need not be a package).
# Examples:
#   # Obsolete with no replacement
#   <pkgX>
#   # pkgY is replaced by <replacement>
#   <pkgY> => <replacement>
