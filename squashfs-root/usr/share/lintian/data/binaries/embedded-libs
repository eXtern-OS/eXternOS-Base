# Manually maintained table of embedded libraries.
#
# Basic syntax:
#   key ||<regex>
#   key || [options] ||<regex>
#
# Where [options] is space separated list of:
#
#  source=<src>
#     - If present, it declares that this library is built from the
#       source package <src>
#     - If both "source" and "source-regex" are omitted, then
#       Lintian will default to using "source" with a value equal
#       to the key.
#     - Cannot be used with "source-regex"
#
#  source-regex=<srcregex>
#     - If present, it declares that this library is built from (or
#       expected in binaries build from) any source package, which
#       name matches <srcregex>.
#     - Cannot be used with "source"
#
#  libname=<name>
#     - Declares the "name" of the library.
#     - If omitted, the key will be used.
#
# Note: Avoid unintended leading and trailing whitespace in <regex>
# as Lintian will assume such whitespace is a part of the regex.
# If possible, consider using \s or [ ] to mark intended trailing
# whitespace.
#
# If <regex> contains the separator (||), then the "options" part is
# not optional.
#
# Please keep it sorted by key.
