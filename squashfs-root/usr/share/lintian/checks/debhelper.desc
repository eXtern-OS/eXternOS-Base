Type: source
Info: This looks for common mistakes in debhelper source packages.
Needs-Info: unpacked

Tag: maintainer-script-lacks-debhelper-token
Severity: normal
Certainty: possible
Info: This package is built using debhelper commands that may modify
 maintainer scripts, but the maintainer scripts do not contain
 the "#DEBHELPER#" token debhelper uses to modify them.
 .
 Adding the token to the scripts is recommended.

Tag: package-uses-debhelper-but-lacks-build-depends
Severity: important
Certainty: possible
Info: If a package uses debhelper, it must declare a Build-Depends
 on debhelper.

Tag: package-lacks-versioned-build-depends-on-debhelper
Severity: pedantic
Certainty: certain
Info: The package either doesn't declare a versioned build dependency on
 debhelper or does not declare a versioned build dependency on a new
 enough version of debhelper to satisfy the declared compatibility level.
 .
 Recommended practice is to always declare an explicit versioned
 dependency on debhelper equal to or greater than the compatibility level
 used by the package, even if the versioned dependency isn't strictly
 necessary.  Having a versioned dependency also helps with backports to
 older releases and correct builds on partially updated systems.

Tag: package-needs-versioned-debhelper-build-depends
Severity: minor
Certainty: certain
Info: The package either doesn't declare a versioned build dependency on
 debhelper or does not declare a versioned build dependency on a new
 enough version of debhelper to satisfy the declared compatibility level.
 .
 The required version of debhelper is not guaranteed to be satisfied
 in all supported releases of Debian and therefore this may lead to
 a build failure.
 .
 Recommended practice is to always declare an explicit versioned
 dependency on debhelper equal to or greater than the compatibility level
 used by the package, even if the versioned dependency isn't strictly
 necessary.  Having a versioned dependency also helps with backports to
 older releases and correct builds on partially updated systems.
 .
 Note if you are using a compat level, which is marked as experimental,
 such as compat 9 in debhelper 8.1.3, then please override this tag.

Tag: dh-make-template-in-source
Severity: normal
Certainty: possible
Info: This package contains debian/*.ex and/or debian/ex.* files
 installed by dh_make.  These are intended to be filled in with the
 package's details and renamed for use by various debhelper commands.
 If they are not being used, they should be removed.

Tag: dh_installmanpages-is-obsolete
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Ref: dh_installmanpages(1)
Info: This package calls dh_installmanpages in its <tt>debian/rules</tt> file.
 dh_installmanpages is deprecated in favour of dh_installman.

Tag: dh-clean-k-is-deprecated
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Ref: dh_clean(1)
Info: This package calls dh_clean -k in its <tt>debian/rules</tt> file
 instead of dh_prep.

Tag: debhelper-compat-file-is-empty
Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Ref: debhelper(7)
Info: The source package has an empty debian/compat file.  This is an error,
 the compat level of debhelper should be in there.  Note that only the first
 line of the file is relevant.

Tag: declares-possibly-conflicting-debhelper-compat-versions
Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Ref: debhelper(7)
Info: The source package declares the debhelper compatibility version
 both in the <tt>debian/compat</tt> file and in the <tt>debian/rules</tt>
 file.  If these ever get out of synchronisation, the package may not build
 as expected.

Tag: package-uses-deprecated-debhelper-compat-version
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Ref: debhelper(7)
Info: The debhelper compatibility version used by this package is marked
 as deprecated by the debhelper developer.  You should really consider
 using a newer compatibility version.
 .
 The compatibility version can be set in (preferred)
 <tt>debian/compat</tt> or by setting and exporting DH_COMPAT in
 <tt>debian/rules</tt>.  If it is not set in either place, debhelper
 defaults to the deprecated compatibility version 1.

Tag: package-uses-old-debhelper-compat-version
Severity: pedantic
Certainty: certain
Ref: debhelper(7)
Info: The debhelper compatibility version used by this package is marked
 as not recommended by the debhelper developer.  You may consider
 using a recommended compatibility version.
 .
 The compatibility version can be set in (preferred)
 <tt>debian/compat</tt> or by setting and exporting DH_COMPAT in
 <tt>debian/rules</tt>.  If it is not set in either place, debhelper
 defaults to the deprecated compatibility version 1.

Tag: package-uses-experimental-debhelper-compat-version
Severity: pedantic
Certainty: certain
Ref: debhelper(7)
Info: The debhelper compatibility version used by this package is marked
 as experimental by the debhelper developer.  You  may consider
 using a stable compatibility version.
 .
 The compatibility version can be set in (preferred)
 <tt>debian/compat</tt> or by setting and exporting DH_COMPAT in
 <tt>debian/rules</tt>.  If it is not set in either place, debhelper
 defaults to the deprecated compatibility version 1.

Tag: debhelper-but-no-misc-depends
Severity: normal
Certainty: possible
Ref: debhelper(7)
Info: The source package uses debhelper, but it does not include
 ${misc:Depends} in the given binary package's debian/control entry.  Any
 debhelper command may add dependencies to ${misc:Depends} that are
 required for the work that it does, so recommended best practice is to
 always add ${misc:Depends} to the dependencies of each binary package if
 debhelper is in use.

Tag: missing-build-dependency-for-dh_-command
Severity: important
Certainty: possible
Info: The source package appears to be using a dh_ command but doesn't build
 depend on the package that actually provides it.  If it uses it, it must
 build depend on it.

Tag: missing-build-dependency-for-dh-addon
Severity: important
Certainty: possible
Info: The source package appears to be using a dh addon but doesn't build
 depend on the package that actually provides it.  If it uses it, it must
 build depend on it.

Tag: brace-expansion-in-debhelper-config-file
Severity: normal
Certainty: possible
Info: This debhelper config file appears to use shell brace expansion
 (such as <tt>{foo,bar}</tt>) to specify files.  This happens to work due
 to an accident of implementation but is not a supported feature.  Only
 <tt>?</tt>, <tt>*</tt>, and <tt>[...]</tt> are supported.
Ref: debhelper(1)

Tag: weak-dependency-on-misc-depends
Severity: normal
Certainty: possible
Ref: debhelper(7)
Info: The source package declares a weak dependency on ${misc:Depends} in
 the given binary package's debian/control entry.  A stronger dependency, that
 is one that ensures the package's installation, is required so that the
 additional commands are available to the maintainer scripts when they are run.

Tag: debhelper-compat-not-a-number
Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Ref: debhelper(7)
Info: The debhelper compatibility level specified in
 <tt>debian/compat</tt> is not a number.

Tag: debhelper-compat-file-contains-multiple-levels
Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Ref: debhelper(7)
Info: The <tt>debian/compat</tt> file appears to contain multiple
 compatibility levels.
 .
 This was likely due to the use of &gt;&gt; instead of &gt; when
 updating the level.
 .
 Please update the file to specify a single level.

Tag: debhelper-compatibility-level-not-a-number
Severity: important
Certainty: possible
Info: The debhelper compatibility level specified in <tt>debian/rules</tt>
 is not a number.  If you're using make functions or other more complex
 methods to generate the compatibility level, write the output into
 <tt>debian/compat</tt> instead of setting DH_COMPAT.  The latter should
 be available for a user to override temporarily.

Tag: temporary-debhelper-file
Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Ref: dh_clean(1)
Info: The package contains temporary debhelper files, which are normally
 removed by <tt>dh_clean</tt>.  The most common cause for this is that a
 binary package has been renamed or removed without cleaning the build
 directory first.

Tag: unused-build-dependency-on-cdbs
Severity: normal
Certainty: possible
Info: The package build-depends on cdbs, but does not include any cdbs
 files in <tt>debian/rules</tt>.

Tag: python-depends-but-no-python-helper
Severity: serious
Certainty: possible
Info: The source package declares a dependency on ${python:Depends} in the
 given binary package's debian/control entry.  However, debian/rules doesn't
 call any helper that would generate this substitution variable.
 .
 The source package probably needs a call to dh_python2 (possibly via the
 python2 dh add-on) in the debian/rules file.

Tag: python3-depends-but-no-python3-helper
Severity: serious
Certainty: possible
Info: The source package declares a dependency on ${python3:Depends} in the
 given binary package's debian/control entry.  However, debian/rules doesn't
 call any helper that would generate this substitution variable.

Tag: package-file-is-executable
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: The packaging file is marked executable.  For control, changelog and
 copyright there is no reason for them to be executable.
 .
 This tag is also emitted if a debhelper file is marked executable without
 using compat level 9, since debhelper does not execute them at lower
 compat levels.

Tag: executable-debhelper-file-without-being-executable
Severity: important
Certainty: possible
Info: The packaging file is marked executable, but it does not appear to be
 executable (e.g. it has no #! line).
 .
 If debhelper file is not supposed to be executable, please remove the
 executable bit from it.

Tag: dh-exec-private-helper
Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Info: The packaging file uses dh-exec, but it does not use /usr/bin/dh-exec.
 .
 If running dh-exec with the default set of helpers is not desired,
 use its --with or --without options instead of directly using the
 desired helper.

Tag: package-uses-dh-exec-but-lacks-build-depends
Severity: important
Certainty: possible
Info: If a package uses dh-exec, it must declare a Build-Depends
 on it.

Tag: dh-exec-script-without-dh-exec-features
Severity: normal
Certainty: possible
Info: The package uses dh-exec in at least one of its files, but does
 not use any of the features provided by dh-exec.
 .
 If the features provided by dh-exec is not needed, please remove the
 executable bit, and the dh-exec usage.

Tag: dh-exec-install-not-allowed-here
Severity: important
Certainty: possible
Info: The package uses a dh-exec-install construct in a debhelper
 config file, where it is not permitted.
 .
 The dh-exec-install constructs are only allowed in dh_install's
 .install and dh_installman's .manpages files, and nowhere else.

Tag: dh-exec-subst-unknown-variable
Severity: minor
Certainty: wild-guess
Info: The package uses a variable in one of its debhelper config
 files, but the variable is not one known to dpkg-architecture.
 .
 It is recommended to use a known subset of variables.  If the package
 needs more than that, and makes sure the variable is exported through
 the build one way or the other, then this tag can be safely ignored
 or overridden.

Tag: dh-exec-useless-usage
Severity: wishlist
Certainty: possible
Info: The package uses dh-exec for things it is not needed for.
 .
 This typically includes using ${DEB_HOST_MULTIARCH} in an install
 target where a wildcard would suffice. For example, if you had:
 .
  #! /usr/bin/dh-exec
  usr/lib/${DEB_HOST_MULTIARCH}
 .
 This could be replaced with the following in most cases, dropping the
 need for dh-exec:
 .
  usr/lib/*
 .
 However, there may be other directories that match the wildcard,
 which one does not wish to install. In that case, this warning should
 be ignored or overridden.

Tag: debhelper-compat-file-is-missing
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: The package uses debhelper but does not ship a compat file.
 This is deprecated and eventually cause the package to FTBFS.
 .
 Please refer to the debhelper documentation on how to create the
 compat file and the differences between each compat level.

Tag: dh-manual-sequence-control-obsolete
Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Info: The package uses one (or more) of the obsolete dh parameters
 to control the debhelper command sequence.  This method has been
 deprecated and is now replaced by override targets.  If you had:
 .
  [...]
  install: build
           dh install --before dh_auto_install
           dh_auto_install -- PKG_DEST_DIR=`pwd`/debian/tmp/usr
           dh install --after dh_auto_install
  [...]
 .
 This should now be replaced by:
 .
   %:
        dh $@
 .
   override_dh_auto_install:
        dh_auto_install -- PKG_DEST_DIR=`pwd`/debian/tmp/usr
 .
 Please refer to the debhelper documentation for more information.

Tag: debian-build-system
Severity: classification
Certainty: certain
Info: This is the build system that Lintian believes the package is
 using.

Tag: typo-in-debhelper-override-target
Severity: normal
Certainty: possible
Info: The listed target in debian/rules command is a likely misspelling.
 .
 This can result in (for example) a <tt>dh_override_</tt>-style target
 silently not being executed by <tt>make</tt>.
 .
 Implementation detail: The typo is detected by using "Levenshtein
 edit distance".  Therefore, if the typo involve several characters,
 Lintian may not detect it.

Tag: maintscript-includes-maint-script-parameters
Severity: normal
Certainty: possible
Info: Lines in a <tt>debian/*.maintscript</tt> correspond to
 <tt>dpkg-maintscript-helper(1)</tt> commands and parameters.  However, the
 "maint-script-parameters" should not be included as debhelper will add those
 automatically. See <tt>dh_installdeb(1)</tt> for more information.

Tag: useless-autoreconf-build-depends
Severity: normal
Certainty: possible
Info: Since compatibility level 10, debhelper enables the <tt>autoreconf</tt>
 sequence by default.
 .
 It is therefore not necessary to specify build-dependencies on
 <tt>dh-autoreconf</tt> or <tt>autotools-dev</tt> and they can be removed.

Tag: debhelper-tools-from-autotools-dev-are-deprecated
Severity: minor
Certainty: certain
Info: The debhelper tools from autotools-dev has been replaced by the tool
 <tt>dh_update_autotools_config</tt>, which was available in
 debhelper (&gt;= 9.20160114)
 .
 The <tt>dh_update_autotools_config</tt> is run by default via the <tt>dh</tt>
 command sequencer.  If you are using <tt>dh</tt>, you can probably just remove
 the uses of the tooling from autotools-dev without doing any further changes.
 .
 If you use the "classic" debhelper style, then please replace all
 calls to <tt>dh_autotools-dev_updateconfig</tt> with
 <tt>dh_update_autotools_config</tt>.  The calls to
 <tt>dh_autotools-dev_restoreconfig</tt> are replaced by
 <tt>dh_clean</tt>, so they can most likely just be removed without
 any further changes.
Ref: #878528

Tag: dh-quilt-addon-but-quilt-source-format
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: The package uses (for example) <tt>dh $@ --with quilt</tt> in
 <tt>debian/rules</tt> but is already using the <tt>3.0 (quilt)</tt>
 source format via the <tt>debian/source/format</tt> file.
 .
 Please remove the <tt>--with quilt</tt> argument.

Tag: debian-rules-uses-deprecated-systemd-override
Severity: serious
Certainty: certain
Info: The <tt>debian/rules</tt> file for this package has an
 <tt>override_dh_systemd_enable</tt> or <tt>override_dh_systemd_start</tt>
 target but the package uses debhelper compatibility level 11.
 .
 The <tt>dh_systemd_{enable,start}</tt> commands were deprecated in this
 compat level and are no longer called. This is likely to cause your
 package to not function as intended.
 .
 Please replace these with calls to <tt>dh_installsystemd</tt>.
Ref: debhelper(7)

Tag: debian-rules-uses-unnecessary-dh-argument
Severity: minor
Certainty: certain
Info: The <tt>debian/rules</tt> file passes the specified argument to
 <tt>dh $@</tt> but it is enabled by default from this debhelper
 compatibility level onwards.
 .
 Please remove the argument from the call to <tt>dh(1)</tt>.
