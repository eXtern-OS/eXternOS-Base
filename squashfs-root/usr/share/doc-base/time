Title: The GNU time Command
Author: David MacKenzie
Abstract: The GNU 'time' command runs another program,
 then displays information about the resources used by that
 program, collected by the system while the program was
 running. You can select which information is reported
 and the format in which it is shown, or have `time' save
 the information in a file instead of display it on the screen.
