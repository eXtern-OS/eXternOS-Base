The HPLIP Launchpad.net site https://launchpad.net/hplip is available 
to get help, report bugs, make suggestions, discuss the HPLIP project 
or otherwise contact the HPLIP Team.

The Debian team values users reports, but we are busy, and so we
kindly ask you to access the upstream support facilities:

Before submitting tickets for support please check the "Browse Knowledge
Base" section from (http://hplipopensource.com/hplip-web/index.html) 
for possible answers to your questions/or for troubleshooting your problem.

For end user support please "Ask a question" at the 
upstream hplip support site: 
   https://answers.launchpad.net/hplip

If you know that the bug you want to report is in the "upstream"
code then please file report in the upstream hplip bug tracking system:
   https://bugs.launchpad.net/hplip

If you feel that the bug is one that other Debian users should
know about then you are welcome to file a report in the Debian BTS
as well.  Please keep in mind, however, that managing bug reports
is part of the maintainers' workload.
