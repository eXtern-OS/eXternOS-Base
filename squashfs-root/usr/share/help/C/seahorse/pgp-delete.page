    <desc>Delete local copies of your keys or the keys of people you
    communicate with.</desc>
  </info>

  <title>Delete an existing key</title>

  <p>If you are no longer communicating with someone, you can delete the copy
  of their GnuPG key on your computer using <app>Passwords and Keys</app>. You
  can also permanently delete a key you own as long it has never been
  published on a key server. Deleting a GnuPG key deletes both the public key
  and the secret key.</p>

  <steps>
    <title>To delete a key:</title>
    <item>
      <p>Select the key. (You may need to show all keys, with
        <guiseq>
          <gui style="menu">View</gui><gui style="menuitem">Show any</gui>
        </guiseq>)
      </p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Right click, and choose <gui>Delete</gui>. Alternatively you can also
      select <guiseq><gui style="menu">Edit</gui>
      <gui style="menuitem">Delete</gui></guiseq> to delete the key.</p>
      <note style="important">
        <p>When you delete a GnuPG key that has been published on a key server, you
        only delete the key in your GnuPG keyring because a copy of the
        public key will still be present on some key server.</p>
        <p>If you delete your GnuPG key, this means that your private key will
        be permanently deleted, even though your public key can still be
        <link xref="pgp-retrieve-remote">retrieved</link>
        from a key server and used to encrypt messages to you that you won't be
        able to read! To prevent such a key from being used, retrieve and revoke
        the key. <!--TODO add link on how to revoke from GUI-->
        The revoked key can then be
        <link xref="pgp-sync">synced</link> with a key server to prevent people
        from retrieving and using it.</p>
        <!-- or when you <link xref="misc-key-revoke">revoke</link> it.- No
        revoking feature yet for SSH keys/PGP master keys-->
      </note>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>In the new dialog, confirm the deletion by ticking the
      <gui style="checkbox">I understand that this secret key will be permanently deleted</gui>
      checkbox, and press the <gui style="button">Delete</gui> button to
      finish.</p>
    </item>
  </steps>
