  <title>Introduction to GNOME</title>

  <p>GNOME 3 features a completely reimagined user interface designed to
  stay out of your way, minimize distractions, and help you get things done.
  When you first log in, you will see an empty desktop and the top bar.</p>

    </media>
  </if:when>
</if:choose>

  <p>The top bar provides access to your windows and applications, your
  calendar and appointments, and
  <link xref="status-icons">system properties</link> like sound, networking,
  and power. In the status menu in the top bar, you can change the volume or
  screen brightness, edit your <gui>Wi-Fi</gui> connection details, check your
  battery status, log out or switch users, and turn off your computer.</p>

  <p if:test="!platform:gnome-classic">To access your windows and applications,
  click the <gui>Activities</gui> button, or just move your mouse pointer to
  the top-left hot corner. You can also press the
  <key xref="keyboard-key-super">Super</key> key on your keyboard. You can
  see your windows and applications in the overview. You can also just start
  typing to search your applications, files, folders, and the web.</p>

  <p if:test="platform:gnome-classic">To access your windows and applications,
  click the <gui xref="shell-introduction#activities">Applications</gui> menu
  at the top left of the screen and select the <gui>Activities Overview</gui>

  <p>On the left of the overview, you will find the <em>dash</em>. The dash
  shows you your favorite and running applications. Click any icon in the
  dash to open that application; if the application is already running, it will
  be highlighted. Clicking its icon will bring up the most recently used 
  window. You can also drag the icon to the overview, or onto any workspace on
  the right.</p>

  <p>Right-clicking the icon displays a menu that allows you to pick any window
  in a running application, or to open a new window. You can also click the
  icon while holding down <key>Ctrl</key> to open a new window.</p>

  <p>When you enter the overview, you will initially be in the windows
  overview. This shows you live thumbnails of all the windows on the current
  workspace.</p>

  <p>Click the grid button at the bottom of the dash to display the
  applications overview. This shows you all the applications installed on your
  computer. Click any application to run it, or drag an application to the
  overview or onto a workspace thumbnail. You can also drag an application onto
  the dash to make it a favorite. Your favorite applications stay in the dash
  even when they’re not running, so you can access them quickly.</p>

  <p>These are separate now. Write another blurb about "Notifications".
  I'm also dropping shell-session-status UNTIL the docs for this get
  cleared up. It was orphaned and incorrect.</p>

<p>If you set yourself to Unavailable, you won’t be bothered by message popups
at the bottom of your screen. Messages will still be available in the message
tray when you move your mouse to the bottom-right corner. But only urgent
messages will be presented, such as when your battery is critically low.</p>

  <p>When you leave your computer, you can lock your screen to prevent other
  people from using it. You can also quickly switch users without logging out
  completely to give somebody else access to the computer, or you can
  suspend or power off the computer from the menu. If you have a screen 
  that supports vertical or horizontal rotation, you can quickly rotate the 
  screen from the system menu. If your screen does not support rotation, 
  you will not see the button.</p>

    them.</p>
    <p>At the right-hand side of the window list, GNOME displays a short
    identifier for the current workspace, such as <gui>1</gui> for the first
    (top) workspace. In addition, the identifier also displays the total number
    of available workspaces. To switch to a different workspace, you can click
    the identifier and select the workspace you want to use from the menu.</p>
    <p>If an application or a system component wants to get your attention, it
    will display a blue icon at the right-hand side of the window list.
    Clicking the blue icon shows the message tray.</p>
