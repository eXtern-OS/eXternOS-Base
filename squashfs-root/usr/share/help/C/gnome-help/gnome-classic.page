<title>What is GNOME Classic?</title>

<if:choose>
  <if:when test="!platform:gnome-classic">
  <p><em>GNOME Classic</em> is a feature for users who prefer a more traditional
  desktop experience. While <em>GNOME Classic</em> is based on <em>GNOME 3</em>
  technologies, it provides a number of changes to the user interface, such as
  the <gui>Applications</gui> and
  <gui>Places</gui> menus on the top bar, and a window
  list at the bottom of the screen.</p>

  </if:when>

<p>You can use the <gui>Applications</gui> menu on the top bar to launch
 applications. The <gui xref="shell-introduction#activities">Activities</gui>
 overview is available by selecting the <gui>Activities
 Overview</gui> item from the menu.</p>

<p>To access the <em><gui>Activities</gui> overview</em>,
 you can also press the <key xref="keyboard-key-super">Super</key> key.</p>

<section id="gnome-classic-window-list">
<title>Window list</title>

<p>The window list at the bottom of the screen provides access to all your open
 windows and applications and lets you quickly minimize and restore them.</p>

<p>At the right-hand side of the window list, GNOME displays a short
 identifier for the current workspace, such as <gui>1</gui> for the first
 (top) workspace. In addition, the identifier also displays the total number
 of available workspaces. To switch to a different workspace, you can click
 the identifier and select the workspace you want to use from the menu.</p>

<p>If an application or a system component wants to get your attention, it
 will display a blue icon at the right-hand side of the window list. Clicking
 the blue icon shows the <link xref="shell-notifications">message tray</link>,
 which lets you access all your notifications.</p>
