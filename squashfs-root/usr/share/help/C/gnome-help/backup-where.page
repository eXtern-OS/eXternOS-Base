    <desc>Advice on where to store your backups and what type of storage device
    to use.</desc>

<title>Where to store your backup</title>

  <p>You should store backup copies of your files somewhere separate from your
 computer — on an external hard disk, for example. That way, if the computer
 breaks, the backup will still be intact. For maximum security, you shouldn’t
 keep the backup in the same building as your computer. If there is a fire or
 theft, both copies of the data could be lost if they are kept together.</p>

  <p>It is important to choose an appropriate <em>backup medium</em> too. You
 need to store your backups on a device that has sufficient disk capacity for
 all of the backed-up files.</p>

    <title>Local and remote storage options</title>

      <p>USB memory key (low capacity)</p>
    </item>

      <p>Internal disk drive (high capacity)</p>

     <p>Online backup service
     (<link href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon S3</link>, for example;
     capacity depends on price)</p>
    </item>
   </list>

  <p>Some of these options have sufficient capacity to allow for a backup of
 every file on your system, also known as a <em>complete system backup</em>.</p>
