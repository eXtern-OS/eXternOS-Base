  <title>Staying safe on the internet</title>

  <p>A possible reason for why you are using Linux is the robust security that
  it is known for. One reason that Linux is relatively safe from malware and
  viruses is due to the lower number of people who use it. Viruses are targeted
  at popular operating systems, like Windows, that have an extremely large user
  base. Linux is also very secure due to its open source nature, which allows
  experts to modify and enhance the security features included with each
  distribution.</p>

  <p>Despite the measures taken to ensure that your installation of Linux is
  secure, there are always vulnerabilities. As an average user on the internet
  you can still be susceptible to:</p>

      information through deception)</p>

  <p>To stay safe online, keep in mind the following tips:</p>

  <list>
    <item>
      <p>Be wary of emails, attachments, or links that were sent from people
      you do not know.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>If a website’s offer is too good to be true, or asks for sensitive
      information that seems unnecessary, then think twice about what
      information you are submitting and the potential consequences if that
      information is compromised by identity thieves or other criminals.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Be careful in providing
      <link xref="user-admin-explain">root level permissions</link> to any
      application, especially ones that you have not used before or which are
      not well-known. Providing anyone or anything with root level permissions
      puts your computer at high risk to exploitation.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Make sure you are only running necessary remote-access services.
      Having SSH or VNC running can be useful, but also leaves your computer
      open to intrusion if not secured properly. Consider using a

      computer from intrusion.</p>
