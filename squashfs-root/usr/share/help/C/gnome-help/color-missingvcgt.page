  <title>Missing information for whole-screen color correction?</title>
  <p>
    Unfortunately, many vendor-supplied ICC profiles do not include the
    information required for whole-screen color correction.
    These profiles can still be useful for applications that can do color
    compensation, but you will not see all the colors of your screen change.
  </p>
  <p>
    In order to create a display profile, which includes both calibration and
    characterization data, you will need to use a special color measuring
    instruments called a colorimeter or a spectrometer.
