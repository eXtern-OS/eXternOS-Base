<title>Why do I have less battery life than I did on Windows/Mac OS?</title>

<p>Some computers appear to have a shorter battery life when running on Linux
than they do when running Windows or Mac OS. One reason for this is that
computer vendors install special software for Windows/Mac OS that optimizes
various hardware/software settings for a given model of computer. These tweaks
are often highly specific, and may not be documented, so including them in
Linux is difficult.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there is not an easy way of applying these tweaks yourself
without knowing exactly what they are. You may find that using some <link
xref="power-batterylife">power-saving methods</link> helps, though. If your
computer has a <link xref="power-batteryslow">variable-speed processor</link>,
you might find that changing its settings is also useful.</p>

<p>Another possible reason for the discrepancy is that the method of estimating
battery life is different on Windows/Mac OS than on Linux. The actual battery
life could be exactly the same, but the different methods give different
estimates.</p>
