  <p>There are a number of reasons why you might not be able to see your

    right and hover your mouse over it to display the rest of the wireless
    networks.</p>

  wireless base station/router and see if the network appears in the list after
  a while.</p>

  turned on your computer or moved to a different location, wait for a minute
  or so and then check if the network has appeared in the list.</p>

  <p>The network could be hidden. You need to
