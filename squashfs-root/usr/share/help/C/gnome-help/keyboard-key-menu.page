  <title>What is the <key>Menu</key> key?</title>

  <p>The <key>Menu</key> key, also known as the <em>Application</em> key, is a
  key found on some Windows-oriented keyboards. This key is usually on the
  bottom-right of the keyboard, next to the <key>Ctrl</key> key, but it can be
  placed in a different location by keyboard manufacturers. Its is usually
  depicted as a cursor hovering above a menu:

  <key>Menu</key> key icon</media>.</p>

  <p>The primary function of this key is to launch a context menu with the
  keyboard rather than by clicking the right mouse button: this is useful if
  mouse or a similar device is not available, or when the right mouse button is
  not present.</p>

  <p>The <key>Menu</key> key is sometimes omitted in the interest of space,
  particularly on portable and laptop keyboards. In this case, some keyboards
  include a <key>Menu</key> function key that can be activated in combination
  with the Function (<key>Fn</key>) key.</p>

  <p>The <em>context menu</em> is a menu that pops up when you right-click. The
  menu that you see, if any, is dependent on the context and function of the
  area that you right-clicked. When you use the <key>Menu</key> key, the
  context menu is shown for the area of the screen that your cursor is over at
  the point when the key is pressed.</p>
