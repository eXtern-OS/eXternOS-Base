  <title>Windows and workspaces</title>

  <p>Like other desktops, GNOME uses windows to display your running
  applications. Using both the <gui xref="shell-introduction#activities">Activities</gui>
  overview and the <em>dash</em>, you can launch new applications and control
  active windows.</p>

  <p>You can also group your applications together within workspaces. Visit the
  window and workspace help topics below to better learn how to use these
  features.</p>

    <p>Add a page on the dash and move the below content there.
    shell-apps-favorites discusses favorites in the dash, and shell-apps-open
    mentions showing the grid of installed applications, and shell-terminology
    has a section on the dash, but none describe it in much detail.</p>

<!-- 
  <p>In the <gui>Activities</gui> overview, the <gui>dash</gui> displays your 
  favorite applications as well as your running applications. 
  The <gui>dash</gui> will place a slight glow behind any running applications.
  </p>
      
  <p>Clicking the application icon will launch it if it is not running.  
  If it is already running, clicking the application will open the last used 
  window of that application.</p>

  <p>Right clicking the application icon for a running application will 
  bring all windows for that application forward. A menu with the titles of your
  windows will be displayed. You can select a window from this menu. It also 
  provides options to open a new window for that application and to remove or 
  add that application to favorites depending on its current status.</p>

  <p>Windows are shown on their corresponding 
  <link xref="shell-windows-workspaces">workspaces</link>.</p>
