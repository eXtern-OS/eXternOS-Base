<title>File manager display preferences</title>

<p>You can control how the file manager displays captions under icons.  Click
<gui>Files</gui> in the top bar, pick <gui>Preferences</gui> and select the
<gui>Display</gui> tab.</p>

    <p>File manager icons with captions</p>
  </media>
  <p>When you use icon view, you can choose to have extra information about
  files and folders displayed in a caption under each icon. This is useful,
  for example, if you often need to see who owns a file or when it was last
  modified.</p>
  <p>You can zoom in a folder by clicking the view options button in the
  <!-- FIXME: Get a tooltip added for "View options" -->
  toolbar and choosing a zoom level with the slider. As you zoom in, the
  file manager will display more and more information in captions. You can
  choose up to three things to show in captions. The first will be displayed at
  most zoom levels. The last will only be shown at very large sizes.</p>
  <p>The information you can show in icon captions is the same as the
  columns you can use in list view. See <link xref="nautilus-list"/>
  for more information.</p>

  <title>List View</title>

  <p>When viewing files as a list, you can <gui>Navigate folders in a
  tree</gui>. This shows expanders on each directory in the file list, so
  that the contents of several folders can be shown at once. This is useful if
  the folder structure is relevant, such as if your music files are organized
  with a folder per artist, and a subfolder per album.</p>
