  <title>I cannot connect my Bluetooth device</title>

  <p>There are a number of reasons why you may not be able to connect to a
  Bluetooth device, such as a phone or headset.</p>

  <terms>
    <item>
      <title>Connection blocked or untrusted</title>
      <p>Some Bluetooth devices block connections by default, or require you to
      change a setting to allow connections to be made. Make sure that your
      device is set up to allow connections.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <title>Bluetooth hardware not recognized</title>
      <p>Your Bluetooth adapter or dongle may not have been recognized by the
      computer. This could be because
      <link xref="hardware-driver">drivers</link> for the adapter are not
      installed. Some Bluetooth adapters are not supported on Linux, so you may
      not be able to get the right drivers for them. In this case, you will
      probably have to get a different Bluetooth adapter.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <title>Adapter is not switched on</title>
        <p>Make sure that your Bluetooth adapter is switched on. Open the
        Bluetooth panel and check that it is not
        <link xref="bluetooth-turn-on-off">disabled</link>.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <title>Device Bluetooth connection switched off</title>
      <p>Check that Bluetooth is turned on on the device you are trying to
      connect to, and that it is <link xref="bluetooth-visibility">discoverable
      or visible</link>. For example, if you are trying to connect to a phone,
      make sure that it is not in airplane mode.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <title>No Bluetooth adapter in your computer</title>
      <p>Many computers do not have Bluetooth adapters. You can buy an adapter
      if you want to use Bluetooth.</p>

    <p>Add link to shell-terminology definition of system status *area* of top
    bar when it has been written, explain that if your network connection is
    through a Bluetooth device it will show up in the system status *menu*.</p>
