 * In the second case, the app @em must supply the name and the

 * If your app does not give the user the ability to add bookmarks and
 * you don't mind using the default bookmark editor to edit your
 * bookmarks, then you don't need to overload this class at all.
 * Rather, just use something like:
 *
 * @code
 * bookmarks = new KBookmarkMenu(manager, nullptr, menu, actionCollection);
 * @endcode
 *
 * If you wish to use your own editor or allow the user to add
 * bookmarks, you must overload this class.
